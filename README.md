# Alvaro Morales Portfolio
Hi, this is my portfolio. I'm a software engineer with experience in web development, mobile development, and cloud computing. I'm passionate about technology and I'm always looking for new challenges. 
In order to learn something new I started to learn about Astro, a powerfull technology that I want to learn and understand. This is my first project using it so I hope it is not a disaster =).
